Isolated, independent star system that is nestled in between the influence zones of the two biggest empires. With a dense satellite network blocking any signals from ever reaching or leaving the surface of it's only habitable planet - [[Nexus]] - relatively little is known about what is going on on the surface. This satellite mesh colloquially is known as "The Veil". 
The planet is run by an entity that calls itself "The Director" that throughout the Epochs interacted with the stellar outsiders and even sporadically admitted visitors. 

The system consists of 5 planets, with [[Nexus]] being the only one with sufficient conditions for sustaining carbon based life, and being the only planet in this system with a moon in it's orbit.
