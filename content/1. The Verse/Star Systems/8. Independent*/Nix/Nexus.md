# The Veil
A dense network of geo-stationary satellites encapsulates the planet, forming a sort of planet size Faraday cage, that prevents communication with and visual scans of the surface.

Due to this fact, knowledge about the surface is scarce but information gathered from the past visitors seem to indicate that most of the Nexus' life forms live within the confines of a singular mega-city that spans half of the largest continent on the planet's surface, or about 35% of the total landmass.
# The Director
Some believe the figure of The Director to be an urban legend. However over the last 100 Epochs, numerous sightings and meetings have been logged, but never documented with a photograph or a recording, which further fuels the conspiracy theories surrounding the existence of The Director. Some governments ([[Elves|Elven Empire]], [[Humans|Hegemony of Man]] and [[Avia-Ra|Avia-Ra Holy Empire]]), have put out official statements recognizing the sovereignty and independence of Nexus after alleged negotiation meetings with The Director which presumably happened in person in an undisclosed location.

# Moon - Umbra
The planet is deemed neutral and does not fall under any particular jurisdiction. Due to that fact, despite Nexus' moon - Umbra, being a barren desert with no infrastructure for sustaining life, it is a hot spot for nomads from all over the galaxy.
