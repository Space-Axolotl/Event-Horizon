High Terra, the birthplace of humanity, is a planet of stark contrasts. It’s a mix of sprawling cities, towering mountains, and scars from ancient wars. Despite its turbulent history, it stands as a testament to humanity’s ability to bounce back from the brink of disaster.

Once divided by near-cataclysmic conflicts, humanity united just in time to save itself. That unity launched them into space, and within a single generation, they’d colonized their entire star system and discovered faster-than-light travel. High Terra became the heart of the Terran Hegemony, an empire that grew as quickly as humanity’s ambition.

The planet itself is a blend of the old and new. Ancient cities coexist with futuristic spires, while preserved wilderness reminds humanity of its roots. Technology is everywhere—orbital elevators, shield fields, and AI-driven systems—but it’s all integrated into everyday life, from bustling spaceports to quiet farming communities.
