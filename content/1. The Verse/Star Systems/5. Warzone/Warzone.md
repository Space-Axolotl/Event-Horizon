In the Milky Way's vast cheese storage, the Warzone is like a shelf stacked with Swiss cheese—full of holes, each one a drifting dead magic zone left by arcane warheads. This chaotic galactic region, once home to thriving planets, is now a wasteland of shattered worlds, uninhabitable debris fields, and endless conflict. The Warzone is ruled by the Warhorde, a tangled web of goblinoid factions—bugbears, gnolls, hobgoblins, and orcs—constantly at each other’s throats. What started as an orcish war has devolved into centuries of aimless fighting, with alliances shifting as fast as the rubble drifts through space. Few outsiders venture here, and fewer still make it back.
