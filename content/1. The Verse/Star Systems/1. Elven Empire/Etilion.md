# Core System of the Elven Empire
> Etilion, the heart of the Elven Empire, is a dazzling system with two habitable planets, both steeped in magic and history.

## The Origin World 
The first planet, simply called "Etilion" by most, is the cradle of Elven civilization. This is the land where the elves were born, and it shows in every breathtaking detail. Vast magical artifacts dominate the landscapes—floating cities, skybound highways, and structures so grand they seem like gifts from the gods. At the heart of it all is the "World Tree," an enormous, ancient tree that houses the Council HQ. Its boughs stretch high enough to touch the clouds, its roots rumored to anchor the planet itself in the Weave of Magic.

Elves born here are raised in an atmosphere of high magic, with sorcery practically embedded in their bones. It’s no wonder that many great mages from across the multiverse make a pilgrimage here, desperate to study even a fragment of elven magical lore. Though the knowledge is vast, the elves don't give it freely—earning the right to learn is a trial in itself.

Over time, the elves who left this system were called "astral elves," venturing into the stars to spread their reach. However, as the Empire expanded, the term evolved to mean elves who live _outside_ the Empire’s jurisdiction. These astral elves live beyond Etilion’s quadrant, often blazing their own paths.

## The First Colony
The second planet, named Unear, is the first colony of the early astral elves. While it was initially a wild and untamed world, the elves used gentle terraforming to make it home. Native elven flora now thrives here, carefully blended into the alien landscape. Unear is the embodiment of balance: a harmonious fusion of nature and technology. Think solarpunk vibes—gleaming towers of glass and metal entwined with ivy, bioluminescent gardens, and sustainable energy powered by the sun and wind.

Culturally, the people of Unear lean more experimental. They're innovators, blending magical tradition with new technologies in ways the origin world sometimes scoffs at. If Etilion is steeped in history and tradition, Unear is the frontier of what elven culture _could_ be.

## Deuxcator
Third planet in the Etilion system. Deuxcator is the seat of power for the elven empire, and all emperors and empresses of the empire have been of Great House Mala’Fiil. Furthermore, Deuxcator is home to the Elven War College and is the center of the empire’s military might. Elves in this house are normally referred to as High Elves.

## Troisha
Fourth planet in the Etilion system. Here, these Wood Elves are taught the secrets of growing and carving the empire’s Forest-Fleet of tree-ships from colossal ironwood trees. While the empire has many other worlds from which it supplies its fleet, the greatest of its shipyards is the whole of Troisha

## Carto
Sixth planet in the Etilion system houses these Fey Elves and the empire's grand libraries and magical vaults. While all star elves are naturally gifted in magic, the fey elves of Carto have the natural advantage of living on a homeworld that directly intersects a galactic ley line, greatly enhancing their powers

## Siink
The ninth and furthest planet from the Etilion sun. It is a home for the dark elves of House Miri’tesh, that outisde of the elven empire are widely known as Drow.
