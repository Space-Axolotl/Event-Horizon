Ask any road traveler what to expect when visiting a halfling town, and they’ll usually say the same thing: soft beds (maybe on the small side), strong ale, hearty food, heartwarming song, and rousing dance; ask any spacer the same question about docking in a halfling Hearthstation, and you’ll hear much the same thing, with a bit added on about potentially unfair species taxes and grumbling about the going rate for parts in the repair shop.
