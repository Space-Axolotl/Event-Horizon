>Home world: [[Etilion]]

Among the oldest and longest-lived races in the ‘verse, elves were the first to harness their magical skill to extend their reach to the stars above. Svelte, stately, and regal to a fault, elves often view themselves as the true masters of the galaxy, a perspective which has sparked innumerable conflicts in ages past. While they are not physically much different from terrestrial elves (save for their tremendously long lifespans), elves of the ‘verse are often referred to as “Star Elves” due to their wildly different outlook and their connection to the great stellar houses.
