>Home world: [[High Terra]]

Of the starfaring races of the ‘verse, only the vect are truly younger than humans, and none have less total time in the sky. Yet, despite that, since the day the first human astronauts bootstrapped their way from [[High Terra]] to the stars, their expansion has been quick, rash, and almost virulent. Within five generations, humans were amongst the most populous races in the galaxy. Despite having a relatively short lifespan, their adaptability, ingenuity, almost comical lack of concern for their own well-being, (along with their apparent ability to crossbreed with nearly any type of humanoid) makes them a force in the galaxy that can’t be ignored.
