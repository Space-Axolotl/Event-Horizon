>Home world: [[Kopriá]]

Easily the most primitive of the space-bound races, the hulking, insectoid skathári are at best reluctant participants in the galactic community, and at worst, isolated Luddite tribes. They have spread further than dwarves and elves, occupying as many planets as humans; despite this, it’s rare to catch sight of a skathári on a Hearthstation, spaceport, or maw, and it’s even rarer to strike up a conversation with one.
