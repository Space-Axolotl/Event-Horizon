Situated at the very center of the galaxy an utterly massive star sits in a slow, orbiting dance with an equally large, tidally-locked black hole. In it's orbit sits [[Solar Citadel]] which is the holiest site in the ‘verse to the the [[Avia-Ra]] - their holy city.

_Excerpt from a paper published by the (WIP name for the Elven institution)_
>Sophisticated scans have verified that some structure exists in the core of the star: a sepulcher composed of incomprehensibly strong exotic metals that can withstand the perpetual inferno. But this is not the star’s only mystery, for the Sepulcher Star is far too massive to be as old as it is; by all rights, it should have burnt out billions of years ago under its own mass. As its orbit closes in on The Core’s black hole, it sheds even more mass, and yet continues to survive. Within a few hundred thousand years, however, the star is likely to be consumed by the black hole altogether.
