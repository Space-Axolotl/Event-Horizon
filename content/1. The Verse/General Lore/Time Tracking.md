# Relative Time
#### Tick - second
#### Pulse - minute
#### Shift - hour
#### Cycle - day
#### Phase - week
#### Arc - month
#### Epoch - year

Due to differences in time between different gravitational fields, people tend to measure time on localized devices and refer to it primarily in relative terms. Things like calendars, on most worlds, are usually used by only authorities / governments for documentation purposes. 

However a somewhat recent invention originating from the [[Dwarves|Dwarven Conclave]] has allowed denizens of the milky way galaxy to track time regardless of the gravitational field you may find yourself in. Measuring what people colloquially call "standard" time. Any unit of time with a "standard-" prefix eg. Standard Cycle refers to a cycle measured in Zero-G environment where time has not been compressed by any gravitational proximity effects.
