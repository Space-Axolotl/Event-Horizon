### WyrmPop
_A fiery fusion of exotic dragonfruit and electrifying citrus, with a sizzling kick of spice. Unleash the wyrm within!_

A sleek glass bottle ribbed like dragon scales. Each variant of WyrmPop has a subtle glow that hints at its burn type: fiery red, acidic green, electric blue, icy cold white, auditory violet, and psychic pink. The cap resembles a dragon’s tooth, jagged and menacing, designed to be flicked open with a practiced thumb, releasing a pressure pop that echoes like a roar. Heat-sealed with a crackling strip that smokes briefly on release.

Cracking it open is like waking something ancient. The burn coils through you differently with each flavor—fire licking at your throat, acid corroding your senses, electricity buzzing up your spine, cold biting like frostbite, sound distorting into distant murmurs, or a psychic pulse leaving you in mild Pins. You don’t just drink WyrmPop; you survive it.
### Gobbo Glup
_A mischievously bubbly blend of sour apple and neon lime, packed with enough fizz to make even a goblin pull a face. Slurp it if you dare!_

Transparent tube-like bottle, made of reinforced glass, filled with neon lime liquid and suspended dark green bubbles that swirl slowly. A pressure gauge embedded in the side ticks up as you shake it. The cap is a reinforced twist-lock to contain the volatile fizz.

At the bottom of the bottle, engraved into the glass text reads: 
> **This is not a lava lamp, you should be fine ; )** 

A tongue-in-cheek joke from the drink's creators, nodding to the market ban on green lava lamps in certain sectors after a series of unfortunate mix-ups involving thirsty punks.

When you tilt it back, the dense liquid slugs down in heavy gulps, echoing a loud glup-glup-glup that makes heads turn. The carbonation detonates up your throat, flooding your sinuses with fizz like a high-speed crash with a soda tanker. Your nose burns, eyes water, but after the assault, there’s euphoria born out of sense of accomplishment. Finishing a bottle isn’t refreshment; it’s a badge of honor.
### ZerøPoint
_A xenon-charged, ultra-cool blueberry frost soda with zero sugar, zero gravity, and infinite refreshment. Drink beyond the event horizon!_

Sleek, chrome-plated canister with frost patterns etched into the metal, constantly emitting a faint mist. The magnetic cap clicks softly open, releasing a hissing burst of sub-zero vapor. Once opened, the liquid inside defies gravity for a few minutes, lazily hovering in place if poured—perfect spheres of icy blue floating like stars.

The sip is glacial, searingly cold yet smooth, with a metallic tang that lingers like space dust on your tongue. Sweetness stripped away, it’s pure function and purity. The chilling sensation crawls down your chest, numbing as it descends. For a few fleeting moments, you feel weightless, as if you unshackled from the station's pull. So please, for Void's sake, drink while seated.
### Nova Blast
_An explosive burst of cosmic cherry and solar-charged mango, packed with stardust energy. Pop the cap and taste the supernova!_

Reflective glass bottle swirling with prismatic gas nebula hues, the colors shifting hypnotically under any light. The label flickers with a holographic warning:

> **Drink and drive responsibly.**

Next to it, an animated clock display ticks down in real-time, estimating how long until you can safely pilot your craft after consumption.

*The drink's creation stems from a failed attempt to synthesize the effects of Roaches. The result instead induced mild, pleasant visual hallucinations resembling starbursts and galactic patterns. Rather than discarding the formula, the creators embraced it—a psychedelic soda for the weary traveler.*

The first sip blooms with sweetness—ripe cherries smashed into molten mango, fizz crackling on your tongue like solar flares. Then the lights start—not outside, but inside. Your vision warps into galaxies bursting in slow motion, stars winking into life across the periphery. You bear witness to the death of giants—supernovas erupting before your eyes, the last breath of ancient stars cascading into new nebulae. The void hums, and for a moment, you swear you hear the universe exhale.
## Hot Drinks
### Manta Black
A matte-black thermally insulated, to-go coffee mug, smooth like polished obsidian, cool to the touch no matter the heat within. The surface is etched with the silhouette of a manta ray gliding through shadowy depths. When tilted, faint blue lines shimmer etched into the walls—like currents in deep water. A pressure-sealed lid hisses gently upon opening, releasing the aroma of rich, overclocked espresso laced with something darker—an undertone some describe as ocean brine, others as ozone before a storm.

The brew hits your tongue like a surge from the trench below. Bitter, potent, with a salt-kissed edge that evokes the deep sea. The warmth spreads through your veins, but the aftertaste is a chill—a lingering trace of the abyss. One sip, and you're awake. Two, and you remember the pressure of the depths. Three? You start hearing the currents call your name.
