## Captain
As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. 
>If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order. 

As a captain, you can use the following actions: 

**_Boarding Party_:** When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus. 

**_Brace for Impact_:** You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1. 

**_Deep Scan_:** If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object. 

**_Fire at Will_:** You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon. 

**_Full Speed Ahead_:** You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement

## Dogfighter 
You deploy in a lighter, more maneuverable vessel to disable enemy fighters and target the vital locations of hostile ships. You can use your action to launch your fighter-sized ship from the main ship or to dock with it while you are adjacent to it. You can only switch roles while your fighter is docked with the main ship. Once launched, you can move your fighter's entire speed on its turn and use your action to fire its weapons. Movement and weapon attacks follow the same rules as the ***Pilot’s Move action*** and the ***Gunner’s Open Fire action***, except that moving your fighter doesn't require an action. You can also take the ***Pilot’s Dogfighting action***. If your fighter drops to 0 hit points and is destroyed, you can use your reaction to eject from the craft in a life pod to survive the explosion.

While acting as a dogfighter, you can take the following special action: 

**_Targeted Attack_:** While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship’s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship’s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship’s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship’s hit points. If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed
## Engineer 
As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active. The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points. At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up. 

As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you: 

**_Directing Power_:** You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship’s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship’s engines, the ship’s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship’s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action. Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship’s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.

**_Overcharge_:** If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship’s engines (increasing the ship’s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again for 1 minute. 

**_System Repair_:** You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn. 

**_Void Jump_:** You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Blind Jump table when the jump begins. 
WIP THIS HAS TO CHANGE TO BE CONCENTRATION SO PPL CAN DROP THE VOID JUMP ON ESCAPING SHIPS

## Gunner 
Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted. While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship’s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons. You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship’s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon’s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC. 

As a gunner, you can take the following actions: 

**_Open Fire_:** You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship’s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. If you score a critical hit on a ship, you randomly disable one of the target ship's systems. 

**_Readied Attack_:** You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship’s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.

## Pilot 
As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions. To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship’s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees. 

As the ship’s pilot, you can use the following actions: 

**_Move_:** You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship’s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score. 

**_Evasive Maneuvers_:** If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship. 

**_Dogfighting_:** If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same. 

**_Hard Turn_:** If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose. 

**_Match Speed_:** Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends. 

**_Ram_:** If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature’s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.
## Recon Officer
Responsible for managing sensors, special equipment, and magical aid in battle, the Recon Officer is an important role in any ship engagement. 

As a Recon Officer, you can take the following actions in ship combat: 

**_Point Scan_:** As an action, you may make an Intelligence (Investigation) roll against the AC of a ship within your sensor range. On a success, you may learn one piece of data about the ship from the following list:

- It’s AC.
- Its remaining and maximum shield points.
- It’s remaining and maximum mega hit points.
- One ship weapon that it has that currently has a gunner.

After you have scanned a ship in this way, the next Gunner to target that ship with a ship weapon has advantage on their attack roll. 

**_Coordinate Tactical Scanners_:** You may use your action to select one other character or yourself on the ship that has the spellcasting feature. They may immediately use their reaction to cast one non-evocation mega spell they know, originating from your ship. For the purposes of sight, they can “see” anywhere within sensor range, as your feed information from the tactical scanners to their console.

**_Activate Special Systems_:** You may use your action to activate any special systems the ship has, such a cloaking device. 

_**Long Distance Hack_:** You may use your action to force a hostile ship within sensor range to succeed at an Intelligence (Data) roll against a DC equal to your Intelligence score. On a failed save, you may cause that ship to suffer one of the following effects until the start of your next turn: 
- Its AC is reduced by 1. 
- One of its ship weapons has disadvantage on attack rolls. 
- You disable one of its special systems that is not in use, such as a cloaking device. 

_**Background Tachyon Scan_:** You may use your action to force a cloaked hostile ship within sensor range to succeed at an Intelligence (Investigation) roll against a DC equal to your Intelligence score. On a failed save, the hostile ship loses the benefits of being cloaked.

## Comms Officer
The Communications Officer is the crew's coordinator responsible for relying relevant data to ensure optimal flow of information onboard the ship. As the Comms Officer you open channels between relevant crew members, hail other ships, receive messages, relay combat directives etc. 

As a Comms Officer, you can take the following actions while at your station on the ship:

**_Battle Stations_:** If you are surprised at the start of combat while at your station and aren’t incapacitated, you can spend your action to loose the surprised condition however this action will give your captain disadvantage on the initiative roll.

**_Watch Out_:** When a friendly ship, including your own, who can see or hear you makes a saving throw, you can use your action, to give advantage on the saving throw. You can use this collaboration before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.

**_Efficient Directive_:** Whenever you take the Direct action and you do not already posses the efficient directive number (EDN), you roll a d20 and the number rolled becomes your EDN. If you are taking the direct action and already have the EDN you may choose spend your bonus action to re-roll it.

When an ally makes an ability check or attack roll affected by your Direct action and you have an efficient directive number (EDN), as a reaction you can replace the result of the d20 roll with the value of the EDN. After you use this feature, you loose your current EDN. 

You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You can only have one efficient directive roll at a time, and you lose any unused uplifting directive rolls when you complete a short or long rest.
