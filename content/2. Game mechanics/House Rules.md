### Surprised condition
if a creature is Surprised they have disadvantage on their Initiative roll, and on their first turn they can only use 1 bonus action and up to half of their movement speed. (no actions or reactions)
### Defend Action
When you take the Defend action, choose one target to protect. The target must be a creature or an object that you can see and is no more than one size larger than you. Until the start of your next turn, the target gains three-quarter's cover while you are within 5 feet of it and not incapacitated. All attacks that are made at the target creature are rolled at a disadvantage. If an attack misses by 5 or less of the targets new AC, it hits the defender instead.
### Free-floating in space
If you have no jetpack / thruster capabilities (or magnetic boots that let you walk on metalic surfaces) then vaccum of space / no grav envinroment is treated as a difficult terrain that halves your movement twice (effective 1/4 movememnt) and round down to the closest 5ft. (eg. 30/4 = 7.5 => 5ft of movement)
### Death saves
Death saves are **privately** rolled between the player and the DM

**At death's door** - After failing 3 death saving throws a player may perform their last final action before they die.

### RIP Counterspell

> The spell _"counterspell"_ does not exist.  
> Instead, **every spell** can be a _counter_ spell **within reason**.
#### Countering a Spell

- You can counter a spell as a **reaction**, but this sacrifices your ability to cast leveled spells on your next turn that would be cast as a spell attack action.
- To counter a spell, roll an opposed check:
    - **Countering Spell Roll** = `1d20 + Spell Attack Modifier + Spell Slot Level Used`
    - **Original Caster's Roll**:
        - If the spell uses a saving throw, roll:  
            `1d20 + (Spell Save DC - 8)`
        - If the spell uses an attack roll, roll:  
            `1d20 + Spell Attack Modifier + Spell Slot Level Used`

#### Outcome of the Counter

- The higher roll determines success:
    - If the counterspell roll equals or beats the opposing roll, the original spell fizzles out.
    - If the counterspell roll is lower, the original spell succeeds as normal.

#### Rules for Counterspell Use

1. **Range:** To counterspell, you must be able to perceive the caster (through sight or magical senses like _detect magic_), and the spell’s effect must be within your spell attack range. 
   
   If the caster is also within your spell attack range and your counterspell succeeds, you can use the spell you cast for the counterspell to deal damage to the caster as if you had hit them with it.
2. **Partial Counter:**
    - If the counterspell roll is within 5 of the opposing roll but still fails, the original spell takes effect with reduced power (half damage, half duration, or diminished effect).
3. **Arcane Backlash:**
    - On a natural 1 during the counterspell roll, the countering caster suffers arcane backlash, taking damage equal to the spell slot level × 2.
