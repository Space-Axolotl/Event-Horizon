### Surprised condition
if a creature is Surprised they have disadvantage on their Initiative roll, and on their first turn they can only use 1 bonus action and up to half of their movement speed. (no actions or reactions)
### Defend Action
When you take the Defend action, choose one target to protect. The target must be a creature or an object that you can see and is noÂ more than one size larger than you. Until the start of your next turn, the target gains three-quarter's cover while you are within 5 feet of it and not incapacitated. All attacks that are made at the target creature are rolled at a disadvantage. If an attack misses by 5 or less of the targets new AC, it hits the defender instead.
### Free-floating in space
If you have no jetpack / thruster capabilities (or magnetic boots that let you walk on metalic surfaces) then vaccum of space / no grav envinroment is treated as a difficult terrain that halves your movement twice (effective 1/4 movememnt) and round up to the closest 5ft. (eg. 30/4 = 7.5 => 10ft of movement)
### Death saves
Death saves are privately rolled between the player and the DM

At death's door - After failing 3 death saving throws a player may perform their last final action before they die.
