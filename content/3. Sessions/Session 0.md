Astrogations Inc. has discovered a Frontier maw station that has been completely offline for centuries. They want to hire you to transport a team of amoeboid engineers to the maw and to explore the surrounding region of space

they should take some astrogations personel - 1 person - with them that they have to protect - vip

they get intercepted by pirates on their way, that caught wind of the new maw and want to go there firs to explore and loot the place - party could either just kill them or make them some kind of a deal to let them loot while they deliver the ameboids.

later either pirates or ameboids get killed, after some searching they discover some creature that made a nest out of this maw and killed all the original inhabitants - that's why the maw was "dead"
they kill it, the end

WIP
make it into a solvable problem to easily invest players into the arc
make finding the monster some kind of a puzzle

the party is also tasked with jumping through the maw to discover what lies on the other side if they manage to power it up, andromeda galaxy on the other side

find a map of a space station and get the party to chase the vortirract around and deal some damage but also let him damage the party - hit and run 
leave some trinkets / artifacts around the station
make the shop inventory for players to do shopping at the start of the game
make a checklist for players to folow as quest objectives from astrogations inc
tailor problems to players to allow them a  moment to shine

terrified ameboid reports a strange creature that ripped apart one of the ameboid engeneers
make the hit and run be theater of mind battle, come up with room / floors descriptions
think about a possible snub fighter

give each or some players unique pieces of information that could come up during the game

make the station into a bit of a mystery where the vorrokith is a red harring, it is a parasite that evolved over the years from some kind of a creaure, the actual reason why the station is dead is the wandering rifts from the andromeda galaxy

make the captain make a playlist for the battle music / pick a soong that plays whenever they hit the void jump

xenobiology lab with skeletons of dead creatures but bunch of vials of poisons are there

how to make the monster scary:
at first mentions in the datapads scattered around the station
a little further in the station, visible signs of battles, reinforcements and carnage
at the last part, a sighting from an npc that saw another npc get ripped to shreds
then hit and run begins + item colection + information gathering

they left captain before the mission
