they should take some astrogations personel - 1 person - with them that they have to protect - vip

they get intercepted by pirates on their way, that caught wind of the new maw and want to go there firs to explore and loot the place - party could either just kill them or make them some kind of a deal to let them loot while they deliver the ameboids.

later either pirates or ameboids get killed, after some searching they discover some creature that made a nest out of this maw and killed all the original inhabitants - that's why the maw was "dead"
they kill it, the end
