each player introduces themselves - a little scene for character exposition
- start with quuyi - Edison Kerensky manager calls him in to ask him to do a job for him that his friend asked him to do 
>**3 hours later** - ask what he does in transit and how he travels
meets with the job giver
sends out requests to other players

F.O.S.S.I.L. - Fully Organic Saurian Sustenance & Interstellar Lunches
 - fast food red and pug; red eating dino nuggies; pug get's pinged from within the company
 >show off the insider entry with his own key card of Pug's character
walk into elevator with various cool labels - Chrono-Probabilistic Mapping Center - xenobiology lab - Exolithic research hub - Temporal Survey Division
then they take an elevator to the Administrative Wing

they are escorted to the brieffing room with the job giver - hard light pneumatic tube elevator

they learn about how they wanted to back-channel that because this is a very valuable info and they didn't want to attract any attention

make them an offer - explore the undiscovered maw station, and make sure it's safe - in exchange of 10 000 000 credits + anything they find onboard the station + their name recorded in history as the ppl that discovered this station - maybe they could even name it

when they agree, gives them a task list to complete

present them with 3 ships to choose from by sending them to the 

tells them about the transport of ameboid engeneers that are gonna help them boot up the station or help with any potential difficulties if any arrise

introduces Jeff and how he is gonna be a person that is gonna verify their job objectives

any questions?

they have some time before the flight

they get on the ship

they void jump

they get to the maw station

land and have a little chit chat with passengers on what to do

get pinged about a presence of some other ship, their IFF flags them as potential threat based on their ship model - they are armed but no faction data is tied to the ship

get ambushed by "pirates" not so far away from the maw station - ask eris to come up with some faction that might be after him

(the pirate leader is a work friend of XXX manager / mentor) - could come up could be missed

either they start a fight with them or make some kind of a deal

if they make a deal one or two of the hired guns attack them anyways and get gunned down by everyone else

they land and set up shop, they decide what the plan is 

they find that some ameboids already went out and started exploring the station

the power is down, they find some sort of a map

WIP room description in the maw station
+lore that they learn along the way

- Xenobiology Logs: “Specimen 17… I swear it was watching me today. The larvae grow too fast—faster than we calculated. I haven’t slept; I hear its claws in my dreams.”
    
- Void Lab Records: “Propulsion test succeeded… but time felt wrong. Simmons vanished for three seconds—said he saw his own corpse staring back. We shut down early; the anomaly… it... I don't know what to think about it.”
    
- Language Decryption Notes: “The symbols writhe when I look away. ‘The Rift Wanders, Minds Fracture’… that’s what I read, but… did I? Words sort of slithered through my thoughts”
    
- Spatial Calculations Journal: “Breakthrough today. We mapped a jump-point beyond the horizon—but it felt like something stared back through the equation. I erased it, but the numbers… they... rewrite themselves.”
    
- Admin Logs: “Hendrik screamed through the vents last night; we found nothing but blood. Johnson says the pulses have a pattern… like speech. I’m starting to understand it.”


make it seem like the xenomorphs were the thing that killed all the ancient ameboids
but as they get further into the maw station drop some lore about experiments centered around extension of void technology by some sort of scientific / magical means.

while they collect lore and magic items the hit and run happens when they get halfway through the maw station

they exchange blows

the alien diappears DC20 perception to see the vent behind some cables

they could bring an ameboid to open the door

the power boots the room as they enter

as the room gets more juice the door slams shut and force fields get engaged, DC10 perception - the door at the other side gets powered up

they see the alien eggs and the vorokith at the end of the room

1d6 turns until the rifts arive

Jeff should be with them so they can guard him

they win the fight

get some lore on what the door was and the rifts that came through

this is where the race that built the maw stations left to

last thing is to jump through the maw

they land in **Messier 31** aka the andromeda galaxy with no way back

THE END
